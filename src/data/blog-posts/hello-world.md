_Bazooka ready? Fire!_ Back in 2010, I was gearing up for my driving exam in
Romania—an experience as delightful as stepping on a hidden mine. 😬💣

The battlefield was barren: no resources, no apps to practice mock exams, and
certainly no safe havens from the relentless bombardment of ads. I had no choice
but to whip out my _construction kit_ and build my own! 💻⚒️

Turns out, I wasn’t the only worm wriggling through this mud pit. Others were
stuck in the same trench, and oh boy, what a blast it was solving that together!
🎯🎉

Now, soldier, you can check out the freshly rearmed and revamped app here:
[test.urssur.com](https://test.urssur.com). I occasionally dive back in,
experimenting with shiny new web frameworks—reinventing the logic and components
like a true tech commando. 🛠️🔥

Currently, I’m doing some _spring cleaning_ (cue Holy Hand Grenade 🎶) and
maybe—just maybe—starting to blog a little.

Stick around, commander! Drop me a line if you dare; links are in the bio below.
Over and out! 💥🐛
