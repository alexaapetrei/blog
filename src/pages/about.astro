    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      *Back in the 90s*—boom! I got my hands on a Russian knockoff of a
      Commodore 64 (Thank you, Dad!) . Plugged it straight into the TV, and it
      was like launching a Sheep into a battlefield. 💥🎮
    </p>
    <p>
      It was pure magic. I could *command the TV* to do my bidding—like some
      kind of pixel wizard! 🎩✨
    </p>
    <p>
      From that moment on, I was hooked on computers. Computers were my bazooka,
      my airstrike, my Holy Hand Grenade. 💻🔥
    </p>
    <p>
      Fast forward to now: I sling code professionally and during my downtime,
      sharpening my skills like a worm prepping for Armageddon. 🐛🛠️

    <h2>What's the deal with bears?</h2>
    <p>
      If you don’t love bears, you don’t love life. Simple as that. Bears are
      the ultimate reinforcements in the battle of existence! 🐻💖
